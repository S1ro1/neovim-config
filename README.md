## A minimalistic neovim configuration

Requires neovim 0.7+
Since i use this to move my configs between computers, i cycle between color themes quite often, <br>
so sometimes each new push will change the colorscheme (how to change it is specified in init.lua)

## Gallery

Currently used theme is gruvbox-baby https://github.com/luisiacc/gruvbox-baby

## Installation
```console
cd .config && git clone https://github.com/S1ro1/neovim-config
```

This creates neovim-config folder in your .config directory <br>
After that u can either:
- choose only parts you like and copy them into your neovim config
- rename newly created folder to nvim and use it as a default configuration <br>

```console
mv nvim-config nvim
```

After that it becomes your default neovim config
